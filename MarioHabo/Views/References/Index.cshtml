    A way to use cookies is to sometime during the visit to find out why the current visitor is visting the site. e.g what service they
    are currently looking for and then using it as parameters to pass him around the service definition page then to reference job's of 
    that type then too the fill out form for that specific job. after that we can always shove like some employee photos of people 
    that might work on his project.

    would be nice if we got that just from the google search, then we can start with doing it immiedietly, this would create the illusion
    of the company specifically being targeted towards this kind of service making first contact and lead acquisition probabillity higher.

    first implement the fucking links though.

    oh and maybe i would have to create another component. that would be nice. but fuck im burnt out.
